	<p><em> Red Dead Redemption 2 Bomb Shot </em></p>

	<p><em> RECIPE </em></p>

	<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 lovers need to check out this Red Dead Redemption 2 Bomb Shot because it’s inspired by the game, it’s potent, and it’s the perfect drink companion to a night of playing Red Dead. While we’ve made other video game-inspired drinks, like the Fortnite Slurp Juice, this one may be the craziest because it’s a double bomb shot recipe that calls for a combination of Jameson Irish Whiskey, Fireball, Jack Daniel’s, and Red Bull. Yes, that is as nuts as it sounds. If you’re unfamiliar with Red Dead Redemption 2, you must’ve been living under a giant freakin’ boulder for the last couple of years, ’cause it’s a really popular video game. According to the Red Dead Redemption 2 Wikipedia page, “Red Dead Redemption 2 broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and shipping over 23 million copies in retail.” We had to make this drink because we really love Jameson Irish Whiskey cocktail recipes, we really love Fireball cocktail recipes, and of course, we really love Red Dead Redemption 2. Now leave us alone, we’re in the middle of a 12-hour gaming session.</p>
